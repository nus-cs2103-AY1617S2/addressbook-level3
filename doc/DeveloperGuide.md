## Appendix A : User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have)  - `* *`,  Low (unlikely to have) - `*`


Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
-------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-----------
`* * *` | new user | see usage instructions | refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App
`* * *` | user | add a new person |
`* * *` | user | delete a person | remove entries that I no longer need
`* * *` | user | edit a person | update a person's particulars when necessary 
`* * *` | user | find a person by name | locate details of persons without having to go through the entire list
`* *` | user | hide [private contact details](#private-contact-detail) by default | minimize chance of someone else seeing them by accident
`* *` | new user | import another address book into current list | move all my contacts from my other/previous device into this system
`* *` | user of multiple devices | sync the address book across multiple devices | access/edit the address book on each device
`*` | user with many persons in the address book | sort persons by name | locate a person easily
`*` | user that needs a few contacts very frequently | "favorite" my most accessed contacts | access my most frequently used contacts easily
`*` | user | label and find persons with tags | access certain groups of people easily


## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `AddressBook` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

  Use case resumes at step 2
  
#### Use case: Rename tag

**MSS**

1. User requests to list tags
2. AddressBook shows a list of tags
3. User requests to rename a specific tag in the list with a new name
4. AddressBook asks for confirmation with the change from the user
5. User provides confirmation for the stated change

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. AddressBook shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2

3b. The new name provided by user is invalid

> 3b1. AddressBook shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 3
   
5a. User provides a negative reply to the confirmation
